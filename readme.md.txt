3. Run each cell one by one to get the users (SpaceX, Blue Origin, Virgin Galactic) their friends ids.
4. Followed by that network for each user is shown using NetworkX.
5. Finally a network is formed highlighting the common users in all three networks.
6. Degree Centrality, Betweenness centrality, closeness centrality and page rank measures are calculated for the network.
7. A Degree distribution graph is shown for degree centrality.
8. Nodes with highest betweenness centrality, closeness centrality and page rank are shown.
